# Architecture

Meet2Notes uses a layered, dependency-inward design:

1. `domain` defines entities, states, errors, and integration contracts.
2. `application` coordinates use cases without knowing FastAPI or filesystem UI details.
3. `infrastructure` implements SQLite, local storage, FFmpeg, and background jobs.
4. `api` validates HTTP input and maps domain failures to explicit responses.
5. `web` is a progressively enhanced local interface using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

The application is assembled in `bootstrap.py`. Infrastructure is injected into
services and handlers. Faster Whisper is the first optional engine adapter; the
domain and application services only depend on `TranscriptionEngine`,
`AudioNormalizer`, and `AudioCaptureBackend` protocols.

## Native audio capture

`AudioCaptureBackend` isolates the application and UI from operating-system audio
details. The factory selects one implementation at runtime:

- Windows uses PyAudioWPatch over PortAudio/WASAPI and exposes real WASAPI
  loopback endpoints for desktop sound.
- Linux uses PortAudio inputs, including PipeWire or PulseAudio monitor sources
  when the host exposes them.
- macOS uses CoreAudio inputs through PortAudio. System sound is shown only when
  the host exposes a suitable virtual or tap-backed input; the capability response
  explains that limitation rather than silently recording the wrong source.

Every source carries a stable session identifier, kind, backend, host API,
channel count, sample rate, default flag, and loopback flag. Capture writes PCM
WAV directly into the meeting's private storage. The service owns the lifecycle
and enforces a single active session with explicit start, pause, resume, and stop.

While recording, each native callback also appends PCM frames to a bounded drain
buffer. `LiveCaptureService` consumes those frames in short windows with a small
overlap, writes an ephemeral WAV inside the meeting's private temporary directory,
and invokes the already-loaded Faster Whisper model. Timestamped provisional
segments are persisted immediately. Word overlap at window boundaries is removed
before the UI receives the next segment.

The browser polls the lightweight capture-session endpoint for level, status, and
segment count. It fetches the transcript only when that count changes. Stopping
registers the complete WAV and schedules a full-file pass against the same
transcription record. Live segments remain visible during this pass and are
atomically replaced by the final result when it completes.

## Process model

Short SQLite operations run in request handlers. Media inspection is scheduled in
the local `asyncio` job queue and executed through asynchronous subprocesses. Jobs
are persisted before they are queued. On startup, queued work is recovered, while
previously running work is marked failed because replaying unknown operations is
unsafe.

Transcription jobs first reuse or generate a mono 16 kHz PCM WAV source. The
engine reports provisional segments while processing; these become final in one
transaction when the result completes.

Faster Whisper owns a dedicated `ThreadPoolExecutor`, separate from the API event
loop and Python's shared default executor. Startup preloads the configured local
model when it is already installed and “keep model in memory” is enabled. The
adapter caches the configured model instance after inference; settings and
capability requests read an atomic resident-model snapshot and never wait behind a
large model load.

The configured `num_workers` value is passed to CTranslate2 and also bounds
concurrent calls into the shared model instance. One worker is the low-latency,
memory-friendly default; additional workers improve throughput for simultaneous
jobs at a RAM/VRAM cost. FFmpeg runs as an asynchronous subprocess, so neither
normalization nor inference blocks the API loop.

### Independent local AI workers

The native AI runtimes never execute model inference on the FastAPI event loop:

- `faster-whisper`: dedicated executor for speech recognition.
- `sherpa-diarization`: one dedicated executor and one resident ONNX pipeline.
- `llama-summary`: one dedicated executor and one resident llama.cpp model.
- `live-ai-assistant`: optional bounded async dispatcher backed by a separate
  summary-engine instance and dedicated single-thread executor.

Each engine exposes preparation, unload, capability and shutdown operations.
Models can remain resident independently, and Settings shows the actual worker
state. Startup model loads are deliberately sequenced to avoid simultaneous
RAM/VRAM allocation spikes; inference remains isolated after startup.

The Live AI Assistant dispatcher is created only while the feature is enabled.
The capture path appends recent context and calls `put_nowait`; when its queue is
full, the oldest pending batch is discarded in favor of the newest speech. The
dispatcher coalesces batches, applies trigger/cooldown/rate limits, and persists
only compact session memory and assistant insights. This prevents assistant
latency or remote failures from back-pressuring capture. Executor isolation does
not provide hardware isolation: running two local LLMs may still compete for
CPU, RAM, GPU, and VRAM.

Diarization creates meeting-local speakers and assigns them to transcript
segments using temporal overlap. Summary generation streams tokens from
llama.cpp so cooperative cancellation can interrupt generation. Before
inference, the summary worker reserves the configured output and safety margin
inside the model context. Oversized transcripts use a hierarchical map-reduce
path: line-aware transcript blocks become grounded evidence reports, reports
are recursively consolidated when necessary, and the selected Note Format is
applied only to the final evidence set. A tokenizer-backed count is used for a
loaded GGUF model, with a conservative estimate as the provider-neutral
fallback.

AI-note rebuilds create new summary and job rows instead of mutating earlier
generations. Manual Markdown edits update only the selected completed summary;
its structured metadata retains the original generated content and the latest
manual-edit timestamp. Neither operation changes transcript segments.

The engine contract includes preparation, transcription, unload, shutdown, and
capability discovery. Preferences keep the selected provider in a separate
`transcription_engine` field and Faster Whisper options in a provider-specific
object, leaving a clean seam for future local adapters or remote API providers.

### Provider registry

`ProviderRegistry` is the single runtime catalog for built-in and plugin AI
providers. It supports transcription, diarization, summary, and embedding
engines plus model-only extensions. Factories are lazy; plugin engines receive
scoped data/model directories and current declarative settings. Rescanning or
changing plugin state atomically replaces third-party registrations and shuts
down removed instances. Routers query this shared registry rather than importing
community adapters in `bootstrap.py`.

Provider IDs and model IDs are validated for collisions. API preference fields
store extensible string IDs instead of closed Python literals. A transcription
provider may return speaker turns together with text; the transcription service
persists them and the final pipeline skips a redundant diarization job. See
`plugin-development.md` for the stable public contracts.

Model download consent is stored in the job request. Faster Whisper runs with
`local_files_only` unless the user explicitly allowed a download. The
`meet2notes-models` setup command provides the same explicit, local-only model
management flow for unattended installation.

## Database

Schema changes live in numbered SQL files and are recorded in `schema_migrations`.
Every connection enables foreign keys, WAL, a five-second busy timeout, and normal
synchronous mode. Deleting a meeting cascades through its database records.

## Historical retrieval

Historical RAG uses the `EmbeddingProvider` boundary and defaults to BGE-M3 through
FastEmbed and ONNX Runtime. Completed active transcripts are chunked on segment boundaries with meeting,
speaker and timestamp provenance. Content hashes make indexing incremental and
changing the embedding provider/model invalidates the relevant stored chunks.

Vectors are persisted as portable float32 BLOBs in the main SQLite database. The
optional sqlite-vec extension accelerates cosine scoring when installed; the same
repository falls back to Python cosine ranking without changing or duplicating the
database. Retrieval forms a candidate union from semantic and keyword results, then
applies configurable hybrid weights and a minimum score before context assembly.

The Prompt service either supplies one full transcript or embeds the question and
retrieves from one/all meetings. Answers receive timestamped source labels and are
instructed to make meeting claims only from that context. See `rag-and-mcp.md` for
the modular extension points and the read-only MCP recommendation.

## Outbound integrations

Webhook producers append typed events and per-endpoint deliveries to a SQLite
outbox. The capture and final-processing services never perform network I/O.
An independent async dispatcher claims due deliveries, applies content-level
filtering, signs the exact CloudEvent body, and performs bounded HTTP requests.
Final events survive restarts; stale Live events expire. Remote-agent responses
are persisted as separate insights and cannot mutate a transcript or summary.

This boundary complements rather than replaces plugin hooks: hooks extend the
in-process pipeline with declared permissions, while webhooks notify isolated
external systems. The stable protocol and change rules are in `webhooks.md`.
