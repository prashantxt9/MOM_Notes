# Meet2Notes roadmap

Meet2Notes is being built as a private, extensible meeting-intelligence
workspace. The repository will become public when the application, extension
API, upgrade path, and security defaults are mature enough for community use.

This roadmap records product direction as well as implementation milestones.
Items marked completed describe functionality already available in the current
source tree; planned items are deliberately split into testable phases.

## Product principles

1. **Keep capture dependable.** The existing local live transcription uses
   short overlapping windows and remains independent from the final pipeline.
   A remote processor must never be required to record a meeting.
2. **Preserve originals.** Recordings, final transcripts, and speaker turns are
   canonical artifacts. Filters and translations create derived artifacts and
   never silently overwrite their source.
3. **Depend on capabilities, not brands.** The workflow asks for a final
   transcript, timestamps, speaker turns, an analysis document, or an export.
   Whisper, Parakeet, Nemotron, Qwen, MOSS, VibeVoice, a Hugging Face adapter,
   or a remote server may provide those capabilities.
4. **Local first, location independent.** A processing stage may run in the
   current process, an isolated local worker, another PC with a GPU, or an
   explicitly selected remote provider.
5. **Extensions use a stable API.** Community plugins register engines,
   actions, filters, processors, and exporters without monkey-patching core
   modules or accessing the Meet2Notes database directly.
6. **Privacy is visible.** The UI must show where each stage runs and whether
   audio or text leaves the computer.

## Target processing model

Live transcription remains as it is today. Modular processing begins after
the user presses Stop or imports a media file:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Capture and current Live ASR"] --> B["Canonical recording"]
    B --> C["Final ASR"]
    C --> D["Transcript normalization"]
    D --> E{"Diarization required?"}
    E -->|Yes| F["Diarization and alignment"]
    E -->|No| G["Meeting document"]
    F --> H["Saved-voice matching"]
    H --> G
    G --> I["Filters and enrichers"]
    I --> J["Optional translation"]
    J --> K["AI analysis"]
    K --> L["Post-filters and exporters"]
```

Every stage declares its inputs, outputs, execution target, progress,
cancellation behavior, retry policy, and capabilities. A composite engine may
satisfy several stages. For example, an end-to-end model that returns text,
timestamps, and speaker labels can skip the separate diarization stage.

The shared `MeetingDocument` contract contains timestamped transcript segments,
speaker references, language information, derived variants, metadata, and
artifact provenance. Model-specific output is normalized at the adapter
boundary.

## Extension model

Meet2Notes exposes two WordPress-inspired hook families:

- **Actions** observe lifecycle events without replacing data. Examples include
  `final_transcription.completed`, `diarization.completed`,
  `analysis.completed`, and `pipeline.finished` (plus failure and cancellation
  variants for terminal stages).
- **Filters** receive a typed artifact and return a transformed artifact.
  Examples include `analysis.before` for translation, redaction, terminology,
  or cleanup, and `analysis.after` for Markdown post-processing.

Hooks execute deterministically by priority. Each invocation has a timeout,
failure policy, cancellation context, structured log, input/output digest, and
plugin version. Optional failures are recorded and skipped; required failures
stop the affected stage.

Python packages advertise plugins through the standard
`meet2notes.plugins` entry-point group. A plugin manifest declares:

- Stable ID, name, author, version, and description.
- Meet2Notes and plugin-API compatibility.
- Hooks and engine capabilities.
- Permissions such as network, recording access, transcript access, or secret
  storage.
- Settings schema and whether an isolated runtime is required.

Installed plugins can be discovered, enabled, disabled, diagnosed, and
rescanned from Settings. Third-party packages will ultimately run in isolated
workers with their own dependency environment. Official trusted extensions may
opt into in-process execution. Provider secrets use the operating-system
keyring.

### Example community extensions

- Translation before AI analysis while retaining the original transcript.
- PII or secret redaction.
- Domain dictionaries, hotwords, and terminology correction.
- Sentiment, topic, compliance, or risk enrichers.
- Additional final ASR, diarization, or LLM providers.
- Markdown, subtitle, CRM, task-manager, or knowledge-base exporters.
- Notifications and post-meeting automation.

## Deployment roles

The target distribution supports three roles from the same codebase:

| Role | Responsibilities |
|---|---|
| `all-in-one` | Web UI, capture, live ASR, storage, and final processing on one computer |
| `client` | Web UI, capture, live ASR, canonical data, and orchestration; final stages may use another node |
| `processing-node` | Inference workers and model cache without access to the meetings database or UI |

Final batch work uses authenticated HTTP jobs, resumable media upload, SSE
progress, and explicit cancellation. A processing node returns normalized
artifacts rather than writing into the client's database. TLS, pairing tokens,
capability negotiation, protocol versions, sequence checks, and visible data
location are mandatory before remote mode is enabled outside localhost.

## Completed foundation

- Native microphone, audio-interface, and available system-audio capture.
- Stable overlapping-window live transcription plus an independent final pass.
- Selectable Faster Whisper, NVIDIA, and VibeVoice BitNet final ASR adapters.
- Runtime-aware CPU/CUDA settings and independently resident workers.
- Sherpa-ONNX, Pyannote Community-1, and isolated `diarize` diarizers.
- Shared saved-voice matching independent from the selected diarizer.
- Managed llama.cpp models, custom GGUF, and local/remote LiteLLM analysis.
- Secure LiteLLM credentials through the operating-system keyring.
- Structured note formats with built-in and custom templates.
- Meeting and speaker workspaces, per-speaker exports, and summaries.
- CPU/CUDA installers, in-app CUDA upgrade, model lifecycle actions, safe
  shutdown, instance locking, dark theme, and hardware diagnostics.
- Reproducible ASR and diarization evaluators with permanent JSON ledgers.
